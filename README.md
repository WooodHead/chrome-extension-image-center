# chrome-extension-image-center

Simple chrome extension to center images over a dark background when viewing them via the chrome builtin image viewer.

[Web Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/view-images-centered-like/damadkdlkdhpeeehnobhpeifjnmfkkjg)

Goals:

- no bloat: no javascript, no background page, only css
- no chrome: no ui, just the image
- does it's job well: you can zoom, compatible with non "image-like" urls, no "white flash"

My orginal use-case: making memes and casting them to TVs.

Other similar extensions:
